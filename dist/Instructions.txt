Version 2.0

1. For the regular REDCap Intake Form only: Make a copy of the APF REDCap report
    - Rename it to include your name
    - Change its visibility so that only you can see it
    - Filter the report for only your divisions

2. Extract this zipped folder to your Desktop

3. Download the *label* version of the REDCap "APF" report
    - It is okay if it contains multiple unimported records

4. Open a Command Prompt terminal:
    - From the start menu, search for "cmd"
    - Select Command Prompt.  This is typically the best match listed at the top.

5. In the terminal, type the following, then press enter/return:
   a. cd Desktop/apf-filler
        - This changes your working directory to the folder you extracted.

   b. REDCap Intake Form: apf-filler.exe "nameOfYourRedcapReport.csv" "Your Full Name"
      Fellowship Onboarding Form: apf-filler.exe "nameOfYourRedcapReport.csv" "Your Full Name" *3rd_Argument
        * The 3rd Argument will either be "fellow" or "resident" depending on what clinical trainee type you are processing
        - This creates XML files for each record in your report in the working directory
        - XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language

   c. "exit"
        - This closes the terminal.

6. Open your chosen blank or template Academic Profile Form in Adobe Acrobat
    - For Clinical Trainee Intake Form data:
        - You must have a template copy of the APF with some answers filled in with your training program's specific default answers
        - The fields you must give default answers for are:
          Page 2:
            Anticipated Start Date (if processing residents)
            Supervisor
          Page 5:
            Project Description
    - Caution: Some of the default answers you have on your template may be overwritten by apf-filler's generic answers.
    - Always choose to save the filled form as a different name (Save As)

7. Navigate through the following menu options:
    - Menu
    - Form Options
    - Import Data...

8. Select one of the XML files apf-filler generated

9. Sign the form, then "Save As" a different name

11. Navigate through the following menu options:
    - Menu
    - Form Options
    - Clear Form
    - This ensures a blank canvas for the next import

12. Repeat the process from Step 7 for each unimported record.
